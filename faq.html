            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                It stands for "Intelligence Quotient". IQ is calculated using a
                person's relative performance to their peers, this is known as
                deviation IQ. IQ itself is based on the g-factor, which can be
                expanded into Gf and Gc (fluid and crystallized intelligence)
                and the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory (although others do exist,
                e.g, Parieto-frontal integration theory). It was once calculated
                using IQ = MA/CA x 100, which is no longer used. This may be why
                you see figures with absurdly high IQs, which is outdated and
                inaccurate.

              <p>
                It is probably the best figure for measuring intelligence, but
                the definition varies. The idea of IQ alone is appreciable in
                its own right; measuring a FSIQ predicated off the faculty of
                others on varied dimensions of cognitive aptitude should at
                least be indicative of something, especially if such a figure
                has been studied to be strongly associated to the variable
                components in life, more than any other test for intelligence
                that is.

            >
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                g factor (also known as general intelligence) is the common
                variance across a range of cognitive tasks. It is derived from
                the Cattell-Horn Carroll Theory of intelligence which models
                cognitive ability hierarchically, with general intelligence or g
                at the top, broad abilities in the middle (FRI, VCI, CPI, etc.)
                and more specific abilities under that.
              </p>
              <p>
                g-loading is the degree to which a test correlates with the g
                factor or general intelligence. A higher g loading means a test
                is better, and figures above 0.8 are generally considered to be
                great. g-loadings are often derived from a factor analysis. A
                g-loading may also be squared in order to derive the variance.
                For example, a test with a g-loading of 0.91 would mean that
                (0.91)^2 = 82.81% of the variance between test scores is due to
                g.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reliability is the stability and consistency in the test scores,
                so if you take tests with high reliability under the same
                conditions then your scores are very likely to be stable.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                It is known as Full Scale IQ. It is the most comprehensive
                measure of 'g' and is derived from compositing multiple subtests
                taken. You may see another index, such as the General Ability
                Index, where it focuses less on memory and processing speed.
                This can be useful for people who have a lower CPI relative to
                their other subtest scores due to autism, ADHD, etc.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                Each of these indices are measures of different subsets of g, as
                defined by the Cattel-Horn-Carrol Model of Intelligence. These
                can be composited to calculate GAI or FSIQ. FRI stands for Fluid
                Reasoning, VCI stands for Verbal Comprehension, VSI stands for
                Visual Spatial, and QII stands for Quantitative Reasoning Index.
                CPI stands for Cognitive Proficiency and usually consists of WMI
                (Working Memory Index) and PSI (Processing Speed Index).
              </p>
              <p>
                FRI is intimately related to PRI and FRI tries to measure
                inductive concepts such as matrix reasoning. It measures the
                underlying ability to figure out a conceptual relationship
                amongst visual objects, and then use reasoning to identify and
                apply rules. The FRI is typically composed of subtests such as
                Matrix Reasoning and Figure Weights.
              </p>
              <p>
                VCI measures verbal concepts such as verbal reasoning. It can
                include both verbal knowledge and comprehension such as from
                drawing conclusions from verbal properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                VSI measures the ability to evaluate visual details as well as
                the visual spatial relationships. The VSI could be tested from
                things such as Block Design and Visual Puzzles.
              </p>
              <p>
                QRI measures the ability to reason and solve problems which
                involve quantitative information, such as through figuring out
                the patterns in a problem when expressed numerically. This is
                usually a subset of FRI.

            <a class="trigger" href="#0">Is IQ genetic or environmental?</a>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                It is mostly genetic, more than 75% of it can be attributed to
                genetics. FSIQ in adulthood can be ≈ 85% responsible.
                Furthermore, the differences between Verbal and Performance IQ
                can have specific differences (e.g., a source says 85% for the
                former and 69% for the latter). Now, environmental factors are
                stronger in earlier years where a developing brain is more
                volatile, but genetics will eventually be the dominating force
                as a person ages (Wilson Effect). Additionally, differences in
                the phenotypic IQ may come from environment, but this will often
                come from extreme changes in environment for the negative bound
                (e.g., extreme malnutrition/neglect).

              <p>
                No, by current knowledge, it is impossible to improve 'g'. It is
                possible to improve scores, but there will very likely be no
                significant physiological change where you will see any vast
                improvements in your actual IQ. IQ is more malleable when you
                are younger where the phenotypic expression for intelligence is
                more variable, so it is more important to ensure you have a
                healthy environment (sleep, diet, exercise, low stress) to
                foster your IQ to the greatest potential it could be. Obsessing
                over it will do little to change your IQ, in fact, it will
                probably contribute to lower scores due to a more negative
                state. Dual-N-Back literature is also quite conflicted, and the
                majority of professionals would reject the premise that any
                brain training program (e.g., Lumosity) would lead to any
                conspicuous changes. Your time is better spent working on
                individual skills than practicing something generalized like IQ
                and anticipating the change to be transitive inclusively for all
                cognitive realms. It is simply better to choose a subtopic and
                specialize in that when you are younger and more neuroplastic.
                Additionally, most drugs are also unlikely to reflect a
                significant change, but drugs like Cerebrolysin have been proven
                to help mitigate cognitive damage.

              >How does age affect my IQ? Why have my childhood IQ scores
              changed as an adult?</a
            >
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                In general, IQ scores tend to remain relatively stable during
                adulthood, but they can change during different life stages. For
                instance, IQ scores tend to increase during childhood and
                adolescence, reaching peak levels in early adulthood. As
                individuals age beyond middle age, there might be a slight
                decline in certain cognitive abilities that are typically
                measured by IQ tests, such as processing speed, working memory,
                and fluid reasoning. However, crystallized intelligence, such as
                verbal comprehension, will continue to increase with age,
                plateauing roughly in the mid fifties.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Wilson Effect states that IQ scores during childhood years
                tend to be unstable and are heavily influenced by environmental
                factors. "The broad heritability of IQ is about .40 to .50 when
                measured in children, about .60 to .70 in adolescents and young
                adults" (Jensen 1998, 169). However, as people approach later
                maturity, the impact of genetics takes over, reaching an
                asymptote of ~0.80 at 18-20 years old and remaining stable going
                forward. As age progresses, genetic influence on intelligence
                strengthens while environmental impact diminishes and your
                childhood scores may have been impacted by this. This may also
                explain the "gifted kid burnout" syndrome. Just as some were the
                tallest in their class as kids but stopped growing and are
                average height in adulthood, those who were "gifted" as kids may
                struggle to meet those same expectations as adults. However, the
                inverse may also be true, comparable to growth spurts.

              </p>
              <p>
                - CAIT is the most comprehensive free test available and can
                measure your Full Scale IQ (~70 minutes).
              </p>
              <p>
                - JCTI is an accurate measure of fluid reasoning and recommended
                for non-native English speakers (due to verbal not being
                measured) and those with attention disorders (due to it being
                untimed).

              <p>
                Most online tests that can be found on Google are probably not
                good. However, there are trustworthy tests linked in this
                subreddit's resources tab, ranked by g-loading and other
                factors. Online administrations of leaked professional tests,
                such as those performed through Discord, are also accurate as
                long as the proctor follows the manual exactly and the examinee
                is in an optimal state, comfortable environment, and a strong
                connection. However, diagnoses from scores should be taken with
                a far larger grain of salt if they're by non-professionals. If
                you took a test in real life, ask your psychologist to interpret
                it first because they can do a better job than with our limited
                knowledge to your situation.

                IQ is a measure of a person's ability comparative to everyone
                else. The scores are usually calibrated where 100 is the mean
                score or average. To put it in perspective, if you score 100 on
                an IQ test, you have an average intelligence quotient. Other
                ranges and classifications are typically around here.

                The standard deviation, on the other hand, is a measure of
                variability. In the case of IQ tests, the standard deviation is
                the dispersion of IQ scores. A standard deviation of 15 means
                68% of the population score an IQ within the interval 85-115 and
                95% of the population scores within the interval 70-130. There
                are three different standard deviation scales, with 15 being the
                most popular and is associated with the Weschler tests, 16 is
                associated with the Stanford-Binet scale, and 24 with the
                Cattell scale. A common misconception from many is that when
                looking at scores without knowing the SD, if the SD is in 24, it
                would seem higher or lower than it actually is compared to an SD
                of 15 or 16.
              </p>
              <p>
                The percentile rank of a score is the percentage of scores in
                its frequency distribution that are equal to or lower than it.
                For example, a test score that is greater than or equal to 75%
                of the scores of people taking the test is said to be at the
                75th percentile rank. In order to convert an IQ score its
                corresponding percentile, you can use a normal curve calculator,
                such as <a href="https://w.wiki/8ssQ" target="_blank">this</a>.
                You will always set the mean to 100 (unless the average IQ in a
                group is different), with the standard deviation set to the
                standard deviation of the test (Usually SD15 like the WAIS, but
                cases vary like how the Stanford Binet uses SD16 and the Cattell
                Culture Fair Test uses SD24), and the Standard Score "z" to the
                score received on the test. The percentile score returned
                represents the percent of the population you will score higher
                than.

                No, it does not mean they are necessarily invalid, as long as it
                is sufficiently g-loaded, the conditions you took them in are
                not significantly disparate, and it was administered properly.
                They are often in the same confidence interval, or you are
                simply misinterpreting the test parameters (e.g., the standard
                deviation). Your IQ scores may differ based on the effects of
                age as well, explained above in the FAQ. Another reason why they
                may differ is that they are measuring different subsets of 'g'.
                For example, someone with strengths in VCI and weaknesses in PRI
                may score higher on verbal tests and lower in matrix reasoning
                tests. Depending on the types of tests you have taken, you can
                use the

                to get a comprehensive overview of your intelligence.
                Additionally, you can simply take an arithmetic or weighted
                average based on your scores.

              <p>
                Yes, they will usually be invalid. The g-loadings VCI tests are
                calculated and normed on native English speakers and will
                therefore not be accurate for non-natives. Unfortunately, due to
                the cultural nature of VCI tests, it is impossible to have a
                test that can accurately measure VCI for everyone. This isn't
                the case for other areas (e.g., FRI), where if directions are
                properly given, then the case is negligible.

                It may be indicative of a neurobehavioral disorder, such as ADHD
                or ADD. There is no way to tell for sure, so professional input
                is greatly valued. Most studies indicate that ADHD itself does
                not lower IQ, but it will impact your cognitive function.
                Additionally, there is currently no direct evidence suggesting
                OCD impacts IQ, but the interference itself with cognitive
                function will affect performance on tasks requiring attention.
                Depression on the other hand has been proven to affect cognitive
                function in CPI related areas, such as memory and an overall
                permeating effect on executive function, but to quantify exactly
                how much it affects a score is a pointless endeavor.

                Practically speaking, you should not let IQ discourage you too
                much from embarking on anything. However, it is true that IQ is
                indeed well correlated to certain occupations, and the effects
                do not necessarily plateau as you go higher. However, as a
                general rule, an IQ of 115 and above should suffice for most
                things, though if you go lower, one may expect more time
                invested in the fields. An IQ past the high 130s will not yield
                any considerable benefit for the majority of people. It is,
                however, still important for those in hyper-competitive areas,
                and there aren't any diminishing returns for those pursuing
                high-tier vocational levels, it is rather still advantageous.
                Regardless, the studies still consider the multidimensional
                aspects of this, considering other lifestyle factors as well.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                You can take a variety of highly g-loaded tests, such as the old
                SAT, old GRE, or AGCT (of course the WAIS-IV and SBV are also
                great, but most people don't have access to them) and calculate
                your FSIQ. If your scores vary often amongst good tests (which
                they shouldn't too much), then you can either take a range of
                the scores or take a weighted average of them based on
                g-loading, or sometimes a simple arithmetic average may even
                suffice if all the tests are good, and a g-loading is not known.

                Yes, the brain will always try to return to a baseline naturally
                after a form of serious trauma (for example, it has been proven
                that traumatic brain injuries can stimulate neurogenesis which
                leads to the proliferation of neural stem cells and
                synaptogenesis). Any form of exercise, such as aerobic and
                anaerobic are beneficial as they bring oxygen and blood to the
                brain (both together are best). Additionally, being and staying
                stimulated on skills you wish to excel in will help you by dint
                of synaptic pruning. The younger you are, the more likely you
                are to recover since you are more neuroplastic (for example,
                look at hemispherectomy recovery rates comparative to different
                ages). Getting proper sleep, will help with preventing the onset
                of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's as
                cerebrospinal fluid will clear away metabolic waste (along with
                many other benefits as you sleep). Additionally, a good diet
                that is low in excessive fats is also good, along with a diet
                meeting recommended nutritional goals (Mediterranean diet is a
                good start). Staying stimulated and cognitively challenging
                yourself is also good. Social interaction has also been proven
                to help. To keep it short, diet, exercise, and sleep are the
                best for maintaining peak cognitive function and staving off
                neurodegeneration.

                Genome-Wide Association Studies (aka GWAS) analysis can
                sometimes be quite accurate, and they work by identifying DNA
                variants that contribute to the variance in intelligence. Due to
                the strong genetic nature in IQ, GWAS can identify man
                single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which have an effect on
                intelligence. The studies so far use a polygenic score which can
                be used to see how predictive it is of IQ. However, some studies
                find that Polygenic scores of intelligence can predict only
                around 4 to 10.6% of the variance in intelligence, so it isn't
                perfect.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                This is an interesting question considering MBTI has been tested
                or inquired about in many scientific articles. The consensus is
                that MBTI itself lacks scientific rigor and exists purely as a
                commercial vessel, but that does not mean the score you get
                cannot be reliable nor accurate if MBTI were to adhere to strict
                definitions and scoring is dependent on a sample size and
                calibration of results. Another alternative would be the Big-5
                which is perceived more positively than MBTI in academia.

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                No, not strongly that is. Fluency in chess is more indicative of
                training and taking advantage of the greater neuroplasticity and
                synaptic pruning one has in their younger years, although
                working memory and processing speed are likely to be the
                strongest factors related to high performance in chess (e.g.,
                see the Polgars). Moreover, chess players such as Kasparov and
                Judit Polgar have both been testesd, and Kasparov scored the
                highest at 135 when he was tested by a magazine that employed
                psychologists. The strongest correlation is likely CPI compared
                to the rest.

              <p>
                Most likely not, but it is impossible to say for certain. The
                test in which Feynman scored 125 on was as an adolescent in high
                school, meaning his scores are not representative of his
                capabilities as an adult. We also cannot determine whether or
                not the test was a verbal test or a full-scale test, though it
                is heavily speculated it was a verbal test, meaning measurements
                of Feynman's strong fluid reasoning skills were likely
                neglected. “According to his biographer, in high school the
                brilliant mathematician Richard Feynman's score on the school's
                IQ test was a ‘merely respectable 125’ (Gleick, 1992, p. 30). It
                was probably a paper-and-pencil test that had a ceiling, and an
                IQ of 125 under these circumstances is hardly to be shrugged
                off, because it is about 1.6 standard deviations above the mean
                of 100. The general experience of psychologists in applying
                tests would lead them to expect that Feynman would have made a
                much higher IQ if he had been properly tested.” John Carroll
                (1996), The Nature of Mathematical Thinking (pg. 9). His IQ is
                most likely much higher than 125, but it's impossible to know by
                how much due to lack of information.
